I also love vintage looks, shabby chic decor and modern minimalist looks.  \r\n\r\nYou will probably notice that there are items to decorate children&#39;s rooms or bathrooms including animals like elephants, whales and butterflies.   There are many colorful peacocks to choose from.  Most of my designs are available on shower curtains, throw pillows, clocks, and phone cases.  Some are even on flip flops and beach towels.  \r\n\r\nAll of the art shown here is my original, copyrighted art.  It includes watercolor, illustration, pen and ink and colored pencil as well as some digital elements.\r\n\r\nI hope you love the fine art you find between these walls enough to bring it home to your walls!  Please contact me if you would like something that you do not see here.\r\n\r\nCatherine\r\n\r\n*adj.
